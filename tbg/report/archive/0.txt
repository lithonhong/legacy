Aim: To study the process of oxidation.

Problem statement: Does sodium chloride prevent the oxidation of malus pumila?

Hypothesis: Sodium chloride prevent the oxidation of malus pumila.

Variables:
Constant variables: Presence of oxygen, exposed surface area of malus pumila and 
Manipulated variable: Presence of sodium chloride
Responding variable: Colour of malus pumila

Steps:
1. A malus pumila is cut into eight equal slices.
2. 12 grams of sodium chloride is added to 500 ml of dihydrogen monoxide.
3. Four slices of malus pumila are added into the solution.
4. The other four slices of malus pumila is left on a watch glass.
5. The malus pumila is left for 30 minutes.
6. The malus pumila is observed.
7. The observations are recorded.

Observation:
= Why don't you carry it out yourself? =

Conclusion: Sodium chloride can prevent the oxidation of malus pumila.
