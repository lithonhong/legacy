        <p>Hi. You're not supposed to be here.</p>
        <p>Do you know that?</p>
        <p>You probably don't, you're probably lost and confused.</p>
        <p>You probably are looking for a real company called Byron, Inc., and found this website. </p>
        <p>In that case, you had found the wrong website.</p>
        <p>Do you need help?</p>
        <p>Here's a button that leads to a blank page.</p>
        <a href="/more/rickroll.html"><button type=button>about:blank</button></a>
    
        <p>You're still here? It probably meant you wanted to come here, then. Have a seat, and go explore.</p>
