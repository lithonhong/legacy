		<p class="jim">Jim: An about page would be good, and you should make one, Byron.</p>
		<p class="byron">Byron: What? I'm no good at writing about myself.</p>
		<p class="jim">Jim: I don't care, just write about yourself. Go.</p>
		<p class="byron">Byron: Tell me what to write!</p>
		<p class="jim">Jim: There are literally millions of examples out on the Internet!</p>
		<p class="byron">Byron: Isn't that plagiarising? Plus, I need creativity.</p>
		<p class="jim">Jim: YOUR READERS AWAITS YOU! JUST GO AND WRITE ABOUT IT! WE ALREADY SPENT ALMOST A PAGE JUST WRITING THIS, WE'LL BE OUT OF BUDGET SOON.</p>

		<div class="about">
		<p>Uh, hey.</p>
		<p>Welcome to my About page, I guess?</p>
		<br>
		<p class="reader">Is that your real face?</p>
		<p>What? You expect me to put my actual face on the picture? No, no, no. That's not gonna cut it.</p>
		<p>Plus, I will share this on websites that do not allow face reveals.</p>
		<p>My OC is kinda accurate though.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="reader">What about your name?</p>
		<p>Nah. I don't want to get banned.</p>
		<br>
		<p>My name is <i>[redacted]</i>, but you can call me Byron. I'm a Form 1 student in Malaysia. And that's as specific as I could, would, and should go.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="reader">But... then why this page?</p>
		<p>Because why not? I have other things to share.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I'm an active user of the Internet. I like to play text-based games on <a href="https://tbgforums.com">tbgforums.com</a>. I also like coding, I have a few Discord bots. Some of them just breaks every day, so I made it a feature instead of a bug.</p>
		<br>
		<p class="reader">Wow, Byron, you're so lazy. Debugging shouldn't be hard, right?</p>
		<p>Uh, actually, had you try coding before?</p>
		<p>Coding isn't that easy. It is when you had mastered it, but learners like me often encounter issues.</p>
		<p>Plus, this isn't my problem, it's the problem of the hosting website I use.</p>
		<br>
		</div>
		<p>I guess that's as much stuff that I would share on this page.</p>
		<p>You may go look for other pages now.</p>
		<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		<p>Seriously.</p>
		<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		<p>There's nothing here.</p>
		<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		<p>I told you about that. And there's no more scrolling for you.</p>
