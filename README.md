# legacy
A legacy version of my website hosted with Replit in 2021.
No longer in use.

A lot of the media is now lost as young me decided Discord is a good image hosting service.
I'm glad the logo is gone; it was staring at its users menacingly.

The website should not contain dead references to the old replit site; please reach out if there are any.

Further details to be added later.
