# legacy

## Overview
This repository is an archive of a legacy version of my website hosted with Replit in 2021 — back when I still go by the alias of Byron. It's no longer in use.

Back when it _was_ in use, it mainly served as a sandbox, besides containing a few joke pages. Young me, young jokes.

A lot of the media is now lost as young me decided Discord is a good image hosting service — I really should have uploaded them to Replit itself? I'm glad the logo is gone, though; it was staring at its users menacingly.

The website should not contain any dead links to the old Replit site; please don't hesitate to reach out if you find any.
