		<h1 class=title>Making A Website</h1>
		<p class="subtitle">6 May 2021 | 03:51</p>
		<hr>
		<div class="blog">
		<p>Making a website isn’t easy. Especially when you’re a busy teenager that has to juggle school, hobbies, relationships, online identity, and a lot of other stuff.</p>
		<p>Yeah, sure, you people out there thinking, “HTML is very easy, you only need a little amount of code and effort to make one.”</p>
		<p>I’m talking about stylish ones. Not the ones that look like the following picture. If you’re making websites like this, try doing some CSS. I’m not trying to convince you that you’re a rookie.</p>
		<p><a href="easter-egg/1.html"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/837969134000013343/838775161670991892/unknown.png"></a></p>
		<p>My website is not interactive yet, I had not (and probably will not) put Javascript into this website.</p>
		<p>I had not been coding with CSS for some time. I learnt about CSS in September 2020 with Khan Academy, which I believe only teaches fake coding. When they talk about Javascript, they mean Processing JS, which embarrassed me when I say print() is for Javascript.</p>
		<p>Any coder that uses Javascript would have known what’s wrong. You don’t use print() to insert text in the console, not in Javascript. That’s the case in Python though, which I mainly use nowadays. In Javascript, you use console.log().</p>
		<p>Anyway, back on track, or as TBGers say, <em>recroperate</em>. The takeaway for the first few paragraphs is that making a website is hard when you’re a busy student that did not touch HTML and CSS for some time</p>
		<p>I suddenly wanted to make a website when I saw all my fellow TBGers having their websites. You know they have one when they linked it. It shows on their profiles.</p>
		<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/764843192310431787/839148980788789311/unknown.png"></p>
		<p>I started a new repl in replit.com (I don't use Github, I can't find the link to the website that is linked to the repositories.) and chose my preferences. I initially named it "Website Test" as I wanted to test out some features in that repl.</p>
		<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/764843192310431787/839149522147868682/unknown.png" /></p>
		<p>That repl ended up being the main website. I renamed it to Byron_Inc, which makes the link shorter, as you can type "<a href="https://byroninc.repl.co">byroninc.repl.co</a>" instead of "<a href="https://byroninc.byroninc.repl.co">byroninc.byroninc.repl.co</a>" to access the websites. Imagine the length of the link when I make pages!</p>
		<p>HTML, CSS, JS files, by default, provided users three files - index.html, style.css, and script.js. I'm not planning on using the Javascript file anytime soon, so I left it blank. At one time I inserted a few alert() windows (just like the <a href="contact">contact page</a>), but I removed it very soon because it is annoying when you have to load the page tens of times a day.</p>
		<p>My styling, in the beginning, is quite simple. I used the &lt;hr&gt; tag, which creates a line, to distinguish the title from the content. There is also a class dedicated to "subtitles" that makes readers understand the title clearer. I slammed in custom colours for the texts, and the title is done.</p>
		<p>The contents. That's the hard thing about making a website. Just thinking about what pages you want could already take you a day. I decided to make a page that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling">rickrolls</a> people, an about page, and a joke contact page (refer to the navigation bar).</p>
		<p>After that, I was thinking if that's what I wanted to do with the website. Just this few pages is not, then what do I want? A blog. With tons of pages where I share stuff.</p>
		<p>Making web pages are hard, but blogs? That just brought it to a new level. I type out all my text on Google Docs, then transfer it to HTML later, as HTML isn’t the best place you can write essays.</p>
		<p>Just writing out the content is a tedious task. You need to spend a few days just to write a compelling piece of composition. Allow me to spend the next few paragraphs explaining.</p>
		<p>First, you have to set a title, a topic that you would like to write about. This topic could not be an easy task though, you need to write over 1000 words about it. The average length of a blog post is 1142 words, and bloggers are recommended to write over 1000 words.</p>
		<p>Next, an opening to your content. A good introduction is very much important to your blog. You will need an intriguing introduction to make people keep reading your blog. This wouldn’t be hard if your lingua franca is English (not me), and you have no problem writing essays in school.</p>
		<p>After that, your content is crucial for your text. Nobody wants to read over a thousand words that consist of nothing interesting. That’s just wasting time. Even if you have a catchy title and a good opening, the content is still essential to your blog, as that’s what the readers need.</p>
		<p>To make the blog interesting, you spend all the vocabulary you learnt in school. Grammar is also unavoidable, you need to check for any mistakes. Fortunately, for me, I have Grammarly installed, so I don’t have to go through all the text. My grammar isn’t strong either, so I killed two birds with one stone.</p>
		<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/764843192310431787/839710274974121984/IapaeG6THGuejKau3xQTNO2qKQnvWqVf682hqMsqe6gq6KwWXl1KlNPoPPq6jxpRIMzIAAAAASUVORK5CYII.png" alt="Grammarly's logo">
		<p>You had written a lot of text, indeed. But you still have to sum up everything you wrote with a good summary in the end. Which I had not done yet, I’m still in the middle of writing this blog.</p>
		<p>Styling is also an important part of a blog. You will have to have a grasp on how much styling do you need. Nobody likes to read a dull blog, and neither do we like texts with too much styling, which just hurt our eyes.</p>
		<p>The key to styling is simple - be moderate. You sure need some formatting to attract the audience but don't get too carried away when you do so.</p>
		<p>If you're like me and type blogs on a text editor and later transform the text to HTML, you'll later realise that transforming the text is such a hassle. I mean, you have to add the tags to every paragraph.</p>
		<p>I personally just use a function in blogspot.com to convert my text. You can use two methods to make blogs on blogspot.com. One of the methods is Compose Mode, and the other being HTML Mode. If you enter your text in one of the methods, you can use the other method to continue.</p>
		<p>If any of you styles your blogs into another class, let me tell you. Please don't. Just open a new CSS file and set your custom style to your default paragraph style. Don't waste your time.</p>
		<p>Making a blog is such a tedious and time-consuming task. I spent over three school days typing on this essay. Time to copy and paste everything, I guess.</p>
		<p>"Wait, this blog isn't intended to just talk about blogs! You’re talking about making a website! You can't just end like that!" Some of you may say.</p>
		<p>You know what?</p>
		<p>You're right.</p>
		<p>What is your takeaway?</p>
		<p>Making a website isn't easy, especially if you're writing a blog with pure HTML.</p>
		<p>That's all, folks!</p>
		<p>(If any of you is wondering, this blog has 1179 words, 37 more than the average. And yes, the last few paragraphs are just me trying to exceed the 1142 mark.)</p>
