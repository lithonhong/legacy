        <h1>Level 1</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>You may have realise that I did not tell you how this game is played.</p>
        <p>Don't worry, I will explain right now.</p>
        <p>In this game, you will have to solve the riddles given.</p>
        <p>But it's not just testing your riddling skills!</p>
        <p>This also involves your knowledge in computer science, math, and your general knowledge. It may be requiring other skills, who knows?</p>
        <p>The way you enter your answer... is a weird one. You have to change the link you're accessing to https://lithonhong.github.io/riddle/[level number]-[answer].html. If it is a single digit, add a 0 in front.</p>
        <p>For example, if you think the answer to level 17 is "fish", you should change the name of your link to https://lithonhong.github.io/riddle/17-fish.html</p>
        <p>The answers are sometimes a single word, sometimes a string of letters or numbers. Sometimes it can be more than one word. Remove any spaces from answers and remove any capitalisation (answers in lowercase only).</p>
        <p>Am I clear?</p>
        <p>I hope I am.</p>
        <p>Are you ready?</p>
